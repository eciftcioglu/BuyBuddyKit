/**
 The `BBKUser` model class represents a user registered to the platform.
 
 Every single user in the platform could be represented as instances of this class, directly.
 There is no distriction between different types of platform users (i.e. customers, managers,
 administrators), all belong to the same class.
 
 ### Identification of a user
 
 Since `BBKUser` objects provided by this software development kit are proxies of the objects found
 in platform, you might need to fetch the same user repeatedly in various contexts.
 Sometimes those contexts might concur with each other, ultimately you might have two instances
 proxying representation of the same entity in the platform.
 You may compare two instances with their instance method `-isEqualToUser:`, which will provide you a
 identifier-based comparison.
 This ensures that those two objects refer to the same entity in the platform, however it does not
 guarantee the validity of the information.
 
 ### Permissions
 
 Due to the nature of the APIs, you will need to perform operations on the platform and every 
 operation is performed on behalf of our web services, hence it is tested against an access
 control system.
 
 Every user might be bound to a permission set, or not. Users without permission sets are not able
 to pass any authorization check on our APIs. Users with permission sets are challenged to be
 eligible to access & mutate some entity, by resolving their *permission*s.
 
 Operations failed due to the access control layer raise `NSException` instances and you should not
 try to catch those exceptions, since they will happen regardless of the time, unless you are not
 being granted a new permission set.
